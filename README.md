# Linear Equation Solver
This C script is intended to solve linear sequences by getting the formula for the Nth term.

# Method
It gets the Nth term by using the formula: Tn = a + (n - 1)d
(a=starting term,  d=difference)

# Example Usage
```console
$ ./a.out 13 9 5 1 -3 -7
13 9 5 1 -3 -7 
d = -4 (difference)
a = 13 (starting term)
Tn=17-4n
```
